## Find matching parenthesis
Implement String prototype method findParenMatch, taking an index pointing into the string as an argument:
String.prototype.findParenMatch = function(pos) {} ;

Based on the given index, return the index of the matching parenthesis in the given string; or -1, Nothing or a similar empty value, if there is no such index.

## Count characters in your string
The main idea is to count all the occurring characters in a string. If you have a string like aba, then the result should be {'a': 2, 'b': 1}.

"    Hello     World   "                  =>  "#HelloWorld"
""                                        =>  false

## Find The Parity Outlier
You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.
